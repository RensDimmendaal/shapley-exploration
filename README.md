# Shapley Exploration 

Shapley value are a nice tool for interpreting blackbox models.
There's a nice implementation in  [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap).


In this repo I explore Shap(ley) in some notebooks.

* Attempt to implement shapley from scratch and see if the results fro SHAP are the same
* A comparison with other feature importances for tree based models
* An example of using shapley to extend a traditional modeling loop

Also attached are slides that I've used at a knowledge sharing session with my colleagues.
